# oligo
A Java class with methods for performing various manipulations on DNA sequences (i.e. oligonucleotides). It was originally written as an intellectual exercise when I was learning Object-Oriented Programming in Java. However, I did find some real life use cases for it in graduate school (for example designing and optimizing PCR primers, parsing results of Sanger sequencing, etc.).

NOTE: As a practicing bioinformatics data scientist, I'd rather use [Biopython](https://biopython.org/). Unless you are writing code as an intellectual exercise, the [Biopython](https://biopython.org/) and [BioJava](https://biojava.org/) open-source projects already contain comprehensive APIs for manipulating biological sequences and genomic coordinates.
